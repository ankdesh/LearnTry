2. Miss
A Miss request is sent to the MSHR when a miss (!s2_hits(i)) or ECC error (s2_meta_corrupt(i)
|| s2_data_corrupt(i)) occurs and the port is not abnormal and is not in the MMIO region.
toMSHRArbiter.io.in(i).valid = true, the Arbiter only sends a Miss request.
3. Both mouths need Miss
Same as above, but both ports meet the condition that s2_should_fetch is high.
toMSHRArbiter.io.in(0).valid and toMSHRArbiter.io.in(1).valid are both true. The Arbiter
sends requests in sequence according to the arbitration order.
4. Duplicate request blocking

When s1_fire is high, it means that we can enter the s2 stage. If s2 has not been sent yet,
s2_has_send(i) := false.B
If a request has been sent, the corresponding toMSHRArbiter.io.in(i).fire is high, indicating
that the corresponding request can be sent, s2_has_send(i) := true.
If the message is sent again, toMSHRArbiter.io.in(i).valid is low, indicatin
